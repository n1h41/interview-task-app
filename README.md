# Flutter App with Clean Architecture and MVVM

This is a Flutter application that fetches a JSON list from an API and displays it in the app. It uses Riverpod for state management, Dio for API integration, and includes integration testing using Mockito. The code is made reusable with the use of Flutter Hooks and Hooks Riverpod, and routing is handled with Go Router. The project follows clean code architecture principles and uses the MVVM design pattern.
